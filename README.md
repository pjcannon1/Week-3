# Weekly Assignment Instructions


### Overview
This assignment will provide an introduction to Conditionals and Looping in Python!

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this assignment, you should be able to read code with conditionals and determine which path a particular set of values will take.  You will also be able to write loops in your programs which will run bits of code repetatively until a specific criterion is met!
 

### Instructions
1. **Review the following materials**:

   - [W3Schools Python Conditionals](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_conditions.asp)
        
        Please read this introduction regarding conditionals!

   - [W3Schools Python While & For Loops](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_while_loops.asp)

        Please read this introduction regarding While Loops.  Be sure to also read the item regarding "For" loops!  The "range()" function is particularly useful when you have a set amount of repetitions you know you'll want to run!



3. **Complete the following tasks**:
   - assignment_1.py:
     
       This assignment will provide an overview of conditionals and for loops.
       
   - assignment_2.py:
     
       Please fix the bugs which are introduced in this assignment!

   - assignment_3.py:
     
       Please write code to complete the tasks in this assignment!
   
4. **Please commit your code to a public GitHub repository**

    - Once you have completed all three tasks in your code please commit your updated python code to a public repository in GitHub!
    - Once you have a public repository link submit that link to the week one assignment in Brightspace!
